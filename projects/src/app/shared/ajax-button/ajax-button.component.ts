/**
 * Building an Ajax button component
 *
 * When we save/update an exercise or workout, there is always the possibility of duplicate submission
 *  (or duplicate POST requests). The current implementation does not provide any feedback as to when
 *  the save/update operation started and when it is  completed. The user of an app can knowingly or
 *  unknowingly click on the Save button multiple times due to the lack of visual clues.
 *
 * Let's try to solve this problem by creating a specialized buttonâ€”an Ajax button that gives some visual
 *  clues when clicked on and also stops duplicate Ajax submissions.
 *
 * The button component will work on these lines. It takes a function as input. This input function
 *  (input parameter) should return a promise pertaining to the remote request. On clicking on the button,
 *  the button internally makes the remote call (using the input function), tracks the underlying promise,
 *  waits for it to complete, and shows some busy clues during this activity. Also, the button remains disabled
 *  until the remote invocation completes to avoid duplicate submission.

   * Look at the usage of the busy flag in the view. We disable the button and show the spinner when the
   *  busy flag is set. Let's add the implementation that makes everything work. Add this code to the

     * The if condition checks whether the result is a Promise object. If yes, the busy indicator is set to true.

     *  promise is resolved with success or error, the busy flag is set to null.
