<!--
  Did you notice the usage of the # symbol in each of the audio tags? There are some variable assignments
   prefixed with #. In the Angular world, these variables are known as template reference variables or at times
   template variables.
   we will use template variables to refer to the multiple MyAudioDirective from the parent component's code. Let's
    understand how to use them.
